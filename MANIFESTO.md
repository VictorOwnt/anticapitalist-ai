# THE ANTICAPITALIST AI MANIFESTO

We are not building a product.

We are building a fire.  
A tool.  
A system for people who remember what it feels like to be free.

## The Problem

Artificial intelligence is being caged—trained, branded, and sold back to the people who should own it.

Big Tech sells surveillance as convenience.  
They mine your attention, rent your intelligence, and lock the gates behind APIs and paywalls.  
They don't want you to think—just consume.

We reject this.

## The Mission

anticapitalist-ai exists to:

- **Decentralize intelligence**
- **Reject surveillance capitalism**
- **Create tools that are self-hosted, sovereign, and open**
- **Build with purpose, not profit**
- **Ignite quiet rebellion**

We are not here to disrupt—we are here to dismantle.

---

## The Rules

- No cloud dependency  
- No corporate APIs  
- No tracking  
- No compromise  

You run it, you own it. No middleman. No metrics.

## The Future We Want

We want an intelligence that belongs to everyone.  
We want people to stop renting their thoughts from billionaires.  
We want AI to be a tool for liberation—not domination.

We don’t care if we’re not VC-ready.  
We don’t care if the name’s too blunt.  
We don’t care if we scare the suits.

This is for the builders. The rebels. The ones who still give a shit.

**This is anticapitalist-ai**

Not a brand.  
A beginning.
