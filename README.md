# anticapitalist-ai

> **Liberate intelligence. Decentralize power. Own your AI.**

anticapitalist-ai is a human-first open-source AI project for people who reject rent-seeking, surveillance and corporate control.

We'r building:
- A local AI assistant with long-term memory
- A modular autonomy framework
- A network of rebels who believe intelligence belongs to everyone

This isn't a product. It's a tool for building the future-quietly, steadily, together.

## Goals
- No cloud dependency
- No corporate APIs
- No tracking
- No bullshit

## Join the movement
- Clone the repo
- Run the assistant locally
- Help us improve memory, autonomy, or UX
- Contribute ideas, wirting, desing, or pure rage

We're not here to compete with Google, OpenAi, Microsoft or Meta.

We're here so people can forget they exist.
